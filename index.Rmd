### Introduction

Tiktok is one of the most popular social media apps of today and had a big impact on how we navigate our online life and also on music. 
In this dashboard I will visualize how music changed as Tiktok got more popular. My corpus contains top hits from 2016 until 2022, in the hopes to discover some trends. If developments in music are found, we cannot necessarily contribute those to Tiktok, but I think it is safe to assume that the rise of Tiktok has played somewhat of a role. 
A noteworthy example I would like to research is the song 'Running up the Hills" by Kate Bush, a song originally from the 1980's, that was repopularized by the series Stranger Things and Tiktok, does that fit in with the overall trend?
