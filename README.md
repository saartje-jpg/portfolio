Tiktok is one of the most popular social media apps of today. I will try to visualize how music changed as Tiktok got more popular. My corpus contains top hits from 2016 until 2022, in the hopes to discover some trends. If developments in music are found, we cannot necesarily contribute those to Tiktok, but I think it is safe to assume that the rise of Tiktok has played somewhat of a role. A noteworthy example is the song 'Running up the Hills" by Kate Bush, a song originally from the 1980's, that was repopularized by the series Stranger Things and Tiktok, does that fit in with the overall trend?
